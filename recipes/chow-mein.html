    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chow mein is a dish of Chinese stir-fried noodles with vegetables and
      sometimes meat or tofu. Over the centuries, variations of chow-mein were
      developed in many regions of China; there are several methods of frying
      the noodles and a range of toppings can be used. It was introduced in
      other countries by Chinese immigrants. The dish is popular throughout the
      Chinese diaspora and appears on the menus of most Chinese restaurants
      abroad. It is particularly popular in India, Nepal, the UK, and the US.
