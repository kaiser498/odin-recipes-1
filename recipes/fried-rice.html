    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried in a wok or a
      frying pan and is usually mixed with other ingredients such as eggs,
      vegetables, seafood, or meat. It is often eaten as a main dish or as an
      accompaniment to another dish. Fried rice is a popular component of East
      Asian, Southeast Asian and certain South Asian cuisines. As a homemade
      dish, fried rice is typically made with ingredients left over from other
      dishes, leading to countless variations. Fried rice first developed during
      the Sui dynasty in China.
